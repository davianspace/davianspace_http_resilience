description: >
  A production-grade Dart/Flutter HTTP resilience package inspired by
  Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience and Polly. Provides a composable
  middleware pipeline with seven resilience policies (retry, circuit breaker,
  timeout, bulkhead, bulkhead isolation, hedging, fallback), structured
  observability, configuration-driven setup, header-redacted security logging,
  and deterministic resource lifecycle — all with zero reflection, strict
  null-safety, and clean-architecture layering.
